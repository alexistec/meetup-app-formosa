# MeetupApp formosa

The goal of this project is to develop an attendance registration system for our tech meetups in Formosa. Since venue capacity can sometimes
be limited, we need an accurate count of attendes for each event.

The app is build with React, Typescript, and TailwindCSS for the front end, and leverages Firebase as the backend for securely storing participant data and managing real-time information for each meetup.
